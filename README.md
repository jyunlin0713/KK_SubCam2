# KK_SubCam2

Configurable hotkey in plugin settings. Default is [Num Pad 1], but it conflicts with a few other plugins.

This is my first plugin and my first use of git/github.

I have no real knowledge of C# just a minimal idea of syntax. This is kind of like my "Hello, world!"

It may not be clean, elegant, or complicated, but the plugin works nonetheless. This is far from where I want it to be, but I have to learn how to get where I want to go with it.

Big thanks to https://github.com/Mantas-2155X for letting me use their code as a starting point, and the guys in the KK Discord server for sharing their knowledge! 

Feel free to make use of this however you like. I do not want it to die here, and I have a lot of learning to do.

Future plans:

-Dragable window

-Resizeable window

-Seperate camera controls per windows
